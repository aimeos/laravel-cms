## Entities and relations

There are four entities use:

* Pages
* Content (elements)
* Page/Content data versions
* Files

The relations are:

* Pages can have several content elements
* Content elements can belong to several pages
* Several page data versions can exist
* Several content element versions can exist
* Page or content data contains the published version
* Files are used by page/content versions (and thus used in pages or content elements)

Here's an ER-diagram of the entities and relations:
